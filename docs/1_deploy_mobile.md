# Part 2:  Deploying the Image Classifier on Mobile

### Assumptions
Part 2 here assumes that Part 1 is complete and that the heroku web app is running and the `final.pth` file is available.

These additional tools were used:
- Heroku
- Expo
- Xcode simulator (optional)

This app lets you submit a photo of food and returns the predicted food category.  :pizza:

The model was developed using the food-101 dataset and the fastai deep learning library, which is built on PyTorch.

## Requirements for Running Mobile App

[Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)  is an iOS simulator for Mac/iPhone users.  Xcode is a large file, at 10 GB.  [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/) is useful for Windows/Android users.  
Xcode is only available for Mac, but Androis Studio is available for Mac or Windows.  

These simulators are not required, though they are helpful in developing the app and provide a smoother development experience.
